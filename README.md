A talk about Impact Mapping.

## Impact mapping

Impact mapping is a strategic planning technique used to define and communicate the impact that a project or initiative will have on a specific audience or stakeholder group. The goal of impact mapping is to ensure that project goals and objectives are aligned with the needs and priorities of stakeholders and that the project is focused on achieving tangible, measurable results.
